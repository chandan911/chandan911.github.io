        <p>Imagine a scene, with 3-4 new grad. ThoughtWorkers, from a recently concluded university term, aggressively
          discussing
          their work preferences as they ponder upon their future at the company. And now imagine one of them saying,
          “<em>I
            won’t really want to join that project because.... [insert irrelevant ramblings here].... plus I don’t want
            to
            go into potentially weird things like Scala, I want to learn & do more of Java.</em>” I don’t think I’ve
          made a
          technically more embarrassing statement in my ever so short stint as a developer. Times have changed immensely
          since then. It’s been close to 10 months since I started learning and working on a pretty large scale
          Scala project here at ThoughtWorks. As clear from the above prologue, I was skeptical if not downright
          hesitant of
          working with Scala, but never have I been happier to be proven wrong. These past months have taken me on an
          intellectually satisfying journey that has transformed my way of thinking about programming in general.</p>

        <p>For the uninitiated, Scala is a multi paradigm general purpose programming language, that ingeniously
          attempts to integrate the best of object-oriented and functional programming worlds. It’s a pure bred OO
          language where every value is an object and every operation is a method call, but at the same time it’s also a
          full blown functional language with first class functions, efficient immutable data structures etc. Oh and did
          I tell forget to tell you that it runs on JVM? So you also get seamless interoperability with Java and an easy
          access
          to years of brilliant work done in that language.</p>

        <p>Scala is an acronym for ‘<em>Scalable Language</em>’. Martin Odersky (Scala’s inventor) says it’s scalable,
          it grows with
          you. I couldn’t agree more. I’ve found programming in Scala to always be an extremely enjoyable experience.
          While it may seem very daunting at first with its arcane syntax and various constructs, it is flexible enough
          to allow you to start as slowly as possible and progress at a rate best suited to you, and I’ve completely
          loved that. You can start off with writing staid Java or even C-style code, but you can also go on to become
          embarrassed of that yourself and write more & more idiomatic code. I’ve been told it’s possible to write
          almost
          Haskell-like code. I’m not there yet but I can confirm the idea of gradual progress in Scala as I’ve seen my
          own
          coding style & abilities transform right in front of my eyes. Although I must admit I was initially taught by
          the biggest Scala enthusiast I’ve ever seen, so that helped as well, but in general the language makes itself
          very accessible to someone new picking it up. Basically it allows to you to easily dive as shallow or dive as
          deep to get your job done.</p>

        <p>I mentioned before that Scala changed the way I think about programming in general. Well I’ve another
          embarrassing little fact to confess. Before starting out with Scala, I was a fan of dynamically typed
          languages. I actually preferred dynamic typing over static typing. There! I said it. But Hey! That has changed
          completely over the last few months. One of the things I like the most about Scala is its brilliant type
          system. When you have a large scale system complete with complex business rules such as ours, types pretty
          much act like a godsend. They help organize your programs way better than you can without them. One of the
          very first advantages that I can think of having strong types is that they act as good documentation helping
          understand program organization and the flow of logic. Also, in my experience, types have saved us from errors
          that could have potentially creeped up till deployment but the compiler just won’t let them pass. Type safety,
          FTW!</p>

        <p>I still remember the days from my earlier project where we were working with Python and how refactoring would
          often mean an arduous effort unless you’ve everything safely backed by unit tests. But with its type system
          acting as an efficient safety net, Scala has provided me with easy yet some of the most fulfilling refactoring
          experiences. This brings me to the third confession I want to make. We here at TW believe in test driving our
          code, i.e., to say we like to do TDD, but I’ve completely ditched it by now. I’ve started doing what one of
          our excellent ex-colleagues introduced me to - Type Driven Development or Type First Development and am
          absolutely in love with it. It’s as simple as it sounds. You use types instead of tests to drive your design
          which often starts with assigning types to your skeleton code and then going on to implement it step by step.
          For those who don’t like the stress of writing types every time every where on their fingers, there’s type
          inference. But in my experience, unless it’s absolutely trivial, explicit type assignments are preferable over
          inference. There have been instances where we let inference do its job and it came back to bite us. While I’m
          still learning it, I find TyDD a good replacement for TDD. Do keep in mind that types are not an replacement
          for unit tests but only provide an alternative to TDD. Although they do help to reduce the number of trivial
          unit tests that you would need to write just to ensure type safety in a dynamically typed language.</p>

        <p>Another reason I love Scala is because it lets me program more but write less. It does away with almost all
          of the boilerplate and you only write intentional code. Its case classes are a perfect example of this. Take a
          look at the below code snippet comparing public class declarations in Java & Scala:</p>

        <p> Java:
          <pre>
            public class Test {

            	private int num;
            	private String data;

            	public boolean equals(Object obj)
            	{
            		if(this == obj)
            			return true;
            		if((obj == null) || (obj.getClass() != this.getClass()))
            			return false;
            		// object must be Test at this point
            		Test test = (Test)obj;
            		return num == test.num &&
            		(data == test.data || (data != null && data.equals(test.data)));
            	}

            	public int hashCode()
            	{
            		int hash = 7;
            		hash = 31 * hash + num;
            		hash = 31 * hash + (null == data ? 0 : data.hashCode());
            		return hash;
            	}

            	// other methods
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Scala:
        <pre>
          case class Test(num: Int, data: String) {
            // other methods
          }
        </pre>
        See, what I mean?
        </p>


        <p>Scala also lets me write much more concise code. You can pretty safely assume 3-4 lesser lines of code than
          equivalent Java. The functional constructs and type inference help a lot here. The option of getting rid of
          dots, semi-colons, parans., & braces unless absolutely necessary, makes your code more readable and hence more
          understandable. This can be a huge advantage for someone just starting out with the language who'd probably
          read code written by others as much as, if not more than, writing his own.
        </p>

        <p>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/tryst-with-scala/scala-code.png"
               alt="scala code">
        </p>

        <p>All this is just scratching the
          surface. Scala has numerous impressive features that do not cease to amaze me. Traits, Pattern Matching, Case
          Classes,
          Options, Higher-order functions, Lambdas and many more – I can't do enough justice to them over here but once
          you've used them, you fall in love with them.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons Scala has become so popular is because it makes concurrency painless & easy-sailing. But
          first let's admit it – Concurrent programming is hard and yet with clock speeds flattening and the number of
          CPU
          cores still increasing, it's going to be the norm going forward. There exist very few languages which can
          achieve it efficiently and not make it a big strain on the programmer. Scala is one of them.</p>

        <p>Our project's architecture is asynchronous and non-blocking. I believe it won't have been possible for a
          complex system like ours to attain that, if not for Scala. We've used Future & Promises to achieve that.</p>

        <p>Although these are no new ideas but Scala with its advanced functional abstractions greatly improves over the
          similar but dreaded APIs already existing in other languages. I was a complete newbie to concurrent
          programming before starting out on this project but apart from a few minor glitches here and there which
          required help from the experts on the team, I've been able to work quite easily with our architecture.
          Frankly, the business logic in our system still scares me sometimes but not its concurrent architecture and
          the codebase.</p>

        <p>But then, there exist no silver bullets either. Scala, or rather working on a Scala based system, though
          brilliant, it has its own set of pain-points that might put you off initially. While they have been worked
          upon and improved recently, scope for betterment still exists.</p>

        <p>To start with, compilation speed is excruciatingly slow especially when working on a mammoth codebase like
          ours.
          There are ways to get around that to an extent and we've had to take extensive steps in the past to tackle it.
          We
          also use a buggy feature of the compiler which allows incremental compilation of our code. It gives us some
          timing improvements but has also bit us very hard a few times. Then there’s also the <em>sbt</em> which is not
          so
          simple as its name might suggest. We’ve had people picking up and having fun with Scala in a few weeks time
          but still struggling with <em>sbt</em> after months on the project. Our team has also struggled to find a good
          mocking
          software for unit testing our code. We use Mockito but using it with tests for our mostly concurrent code is
          often extremely painful and tricky. Many of us (including I) have spent hours frustrated after getting a
          functionality up but struggling to finish its tests because the mocks just won’t comply. Apart from these, if
          you like to use IDEs but don’t own an IntelliJ Idea Ultimate license, you’ll have to suffer while working on a
          large scale Scala project. All in all, you could say that more than the language itself, it’s the tools around
          it that build negative
          connotations in peoples’ minds about Scala.</p>

        <p>But let none of that disillusion you from trying out Scala. There are flaws in every human invention. It
          might seem difficult at first but it’s a very powerful tool that you’d return to often once you’ve learned how
          to
          use it well. It’s not trivial and yet simple. It’s sophisticated and yet not complex. I’ve personally found it
          very pragmatic unlike the idealism of Haskell and their ilk or the laziness of dynamic languages.</p>

        <p>Personally after having worked with it professionally for many months, I feel its easy to get started with
          Scala. You can
          do that over a weekend. It’s also a great language to start off with functional programming. You can do it at
          your own pace. I like it slow & steady. And this has helped me rekindle my interest in mathematics too. It’s
          just that there’s so much out there in this brilliant language, that people trying it out often end up
          frightened. So you must be patient at the start and try and swim in the shallow end of the pool before diving
          into the deep end because you may drown if you’re unprepared and no one likes drowning. So go, give it a
          try....</p>
